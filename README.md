# Component Tester – Proyecto de residencia profesional

This repository contains my **Proyecto de residencia profesional**, developed at the *Instituto Tecnológico de Tijuana* for **CETis No. 58**.

The project consists of an electronic component tester capable of evaluating up to **20 component families**, providing diagnostic and operational information for each component. The system is designed to support educational and practical electronics work by allowing users to verify the correct operation of common electronic components.

## Supported component families

- **Logic gates:** 74LS00, 74LS02, 74LS04, 74LS08, 74LS32, and 74LS86  
- **Linear voltage regulators:** LM317, LM337, LM7805, LM7812, and LM7912  
- **Diodes:** rectifier diodes (1N400x series), LEDs, and Schottky diodes  
- **Integrated circuits:** NE555 and LM741  
- **Motors:** SG90 / MOT1XX servo motors and 28BYJ-48 stepper motor  
- **Other components:** resistors and capacitors
